# Weather Classification - Computer Vision's Course Project
## How to run
Open the 'weatherclassification.ipynb' python notebook with jupyter and run all the code.
All the other python files represent classes that are used inside the notebook.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to classify a set of images based on the weather conditions. For doing this we developed an algorithm that computes a descriptor for each image (based on the image colors, sharpness, gradient, and luminance) and then classifies the images exploiting those descriptors and a neural network.
